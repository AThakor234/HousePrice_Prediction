# California House Price Prediction

## Overview:
The overview of the project is to develop a Machine Learning Model to predict the housing prices in the State of California. 

## Resources:
* Language: Python, SQL 
* Tools: JupyterNotebook, QuickDatabase, Tableau
* Database: Postgres
* Dataset: [Project_Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/californiahouseprices)

## Data Exploration on the dataset in Python:
The dataset was extracted as .csv file from the Kaggle.com. As part of the transformation, we applied series of rules/functions to the extracted data. This was inorder to load the transformed data into Postgres database. 

## ERD:

## Mockup of the Machine Learning Models:
The housing price will be predicted using the Linear Regression Model. Additionally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and RandomForest machine learning models will be used to predict the house prices based on factors such as the location and total livable area. 

## Outline of the Dashboard:
* Heatmap illustrating the Housing Price Vs Location 
* Histogram illustrating the Housing Price Vs Type of House
* Bar/Pie chart illustrating the Housing Price Vs Features 
* Linear line graph illustrating the Housing Price Vs  
* Scatter Plot illustrating the Price vs Total livable area, Price vs School score/distance
