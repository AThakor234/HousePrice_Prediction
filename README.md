# HousePrice_Prediction
Overview The overview of this group project is basically applying ETL on a CSV dataset named California House prices which was extracted from Kaggle.com to solve some business problems and prediction. We performed ETL on the dataset in order to have a clean dataset and utilize useful features for our business questions which are;

What are the important factors that determine a house price ?
How accurate can the model predict the price of a house?
What types of homes are more likely to be sold in the next 5 years ?
For the purpose of accuracy, we use Python to accomplish our data exploration,created an ER diagram for our database and also created a mockup of our machine learning models, using "Sold price" as our output and the most useful features as input.

Attached ER Diagram Below.
